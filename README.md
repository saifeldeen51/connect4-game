# Connect 4 Console-Game

This is a console-based Connect 4 game that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the computer's moves. The game features:

- The user moves first and uses the 'x' token with blue color, while the computer uses the 'o' token with red color.
- The user can choose to play at different difficulty levels, ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the easiest level.
- The user can play again when the game is ended without the need to run the files from the beginning.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.
3. Run the following command to start the game: 


4. Choose the difficulty level by entering a number from 1 to 5.
5. To make a move, enter the column number where you want to drop your token.
6. The game ends when either the user or the computer gets four tokens in a row or when the board is full.
7. To play again, simply enter 'Y' when prompted.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Terminal or command prompt.

## Algorithm

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm that is commonly used in game theory to determine the best move for a player. In this game, the algorithm evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes by simulating the game to the end.

To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, alpha-beta pruning is used to prune branches of the game tree that are guaranteed to be unprofitable. This significantly reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated, allowing the algorithm to search deeper into the game tree and make better decisions.
